# Installation instructions:
# pip install --upgrade google-cloud-aiplatform numpy

import vertexai # Use Vertex AI SDK
from vertexai.preview.language_models import TextEmbeddingModel # Specific model class
import os
import sys
import numpy as np # Added for similarity calculation
# Removed google.genai imports
# --- Configuration ---
# Option 1: Set Environment Variables (Recommended)
# Ensure these environment variables are set before running the script:
# export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-gcp-project-id"
# export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="your-gcp-location" # e.g., us-central1
# export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=True

# Option 2: Set Project ID and Location directly in the script (Less Secure)
# If you prefer not to use environment variables, uncomment and set these variables:
os.environ["GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT"] = "elemental-day-467117-h4"
os.environ["GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION"] = "us-central1"
# Removed GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI as it's not needed for google-cloud-aiplatform SDK
