The good old office, now extinct\r\nin the State of New York, of a Master in Chancery, had been conferred\r\nupon me. It was not a very arduous office, but very pleasantly\r\nremunerative. I seldom lose my temper; much more seldom indulge in\r\ndangerous indignation at wrongs and outrages; but I must be permitted\r\nto be rash here and declare, that I consider the sudden and violent\r\nabrogation of the office of Master in Chancery, by the new\r\nConstitution, as a—premature act; inasmuch as I had counted upon a\r\nlife-lease of the profits, whereas I only received those of a few short\r\nyears.

These may seem\r\nnames, the like of which are not usually found in the Directory. In\r\ntruth they were nicknames, mutually conferred upon each other by my\r\nthree clerks, and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or\r\ncharacters.

It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one\r\nof those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the\r\noriginal sources, and in his case those are very small.

According to my humor I threw open these doors, or\r\nclosed them. I resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the\r\nfolding-doors, but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man\r\nwithin easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be done.

It became necessary to examine them. It was an important\r\nsuit, and great accuracy was imperative. Having all things arranged I\r\ncalled Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut from the next room, meaning to\r\nplace the four copies in the hands of my four clerks, while I should\r\nread from the original.

Of course, from behind the screen the\r\nusual answer, “I prefer not to,” was sure to come; and then, how could\r\na human creature with the common infirmities of our nature, refrain\r\nfrom bitterly exclaiming upon such perverseness—such unreasonableness.\r\nHowever, every added repulse of this sort which I received only tended\r\nto lessen the probability of my repeating the inadvertence.",

He seemed\r\nsuffering from an unusually bad night’s rest, induced by severer\r\nindigestion than common. He overheard those final words of Bartleby.\r\n\r\n“_Prefer not_, eh?” gritted Nippers—“I’d _prefer_ him, if I were you,\r\nsir,” addressing me—“I’d _prefer_ him; I’d give him preferences, the\r\nstubborn mule!

The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the\r\nduties of a mere copyist, an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly\r\nprofessional affairs, such as the original drawing up of legal\r\ndocuments.

Having all things arranged I\r\ncalled Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut from the next room, meaning to\r\nplace the four copies in the hands of my four clerks, while I should\r\nread from the original.

Within\r\nthree feet of the panes was a wall, and the light came down from far\r\nabove, between two lofty buildings, as from a very small opening in a\r\ndome. Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I procured a high\r\ngreen folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby from my\r\nsight, though not remove him from my voice.

His\r\nsteadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry",
                "angry spark from him answerable to my own. But indeed I might as well\r\nhave essayed to strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor\r\nsoap. But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the\r\nfollowing little scene ensued:\r\n\r\n“Bartleby,” said I, “when those papers are all copied, I will compare\r\nthem with you.”\r\n\r\n“I would prefer not to.”\r\n\r\n“How? Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?”\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nI threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Turkey and\r\nNippers, exclaimed in an excited manner—\r\n\r\n“He says, a second time, he won’t examine his papers. What do you think\r\nof it, Turkey?”\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon, be it remembered. Turkey sat glowing like a brass\r\nboiler, his bald head steaming, his hands reeling among his blotted\r\npapers.",

But there was something about Bartleby that not only\r\nstrangely disarmed me, but in a wonderful manner touched and\r\ndisconcerted me. I began to reason with him.\r\n\r\n“These are your own copies we are about to examine. It is labor saving\r\nto you, because one examination will answer for your four papers. It is\r\ncommon usage. Every copyist is bound to help examine his copy. Is it\r\nnot so? Will you not speak? Answer!”\r\n\r\n“I prefer not to,” he replied in a flute-like tone. It seemed to me\r\nthat while I had been addressing him, he carefully revolved every\r\nstatement that I made; fully comprehended the meaning; could not\r\ngainsay the irresistible conclusions; but, at the same time, some",
                "is any thing for me.”\r\n\r\n“I would prefer not to.”\r\n\r\n“You _will_ not?”\r\n\r\n“I _prefer_ not.”\r\n\r\nI staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study. My blind\r\ninveteracy returned. Was there any other thing in which I could procure\r\nmyself to be ignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?—my\r\nhired clerk? What added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he\r\nwill be sure to refuse to do?\r\n\r\n“Bartleby!”\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n“Bartleby,” in a louder tone.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n“Bartleby,” I roared.\r\n\r\nLike a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the\r\nthird summons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage.\r\n\r\n“Go to the next room, and tell Nippers to come to me.”\r\n\r\n“I prefer not to,” he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly\r\ndisappeared.",
                "papers to-morrow or next day: in short, say now that in a day or two\r\nyou will begin to be a little reasonable:—say so, Bartleby.”\r\n\r\n“At present I would prefer not to be a little reasonable,” was his\r\nmildly cadaverous reply.\r\n\r\nJust then the folding-doors opened, and Nippers approached. He seemed\r\nsuffering from an unusually bad night’s rest, induced by severer\r\nindigestion than common. He overheard those final words of Bartleby.\r\n\r\n“_Prefer not_, eh?” gritted Nippers—“I’d _prefer_ him, if I were you,\r\nsir,” addressing me—“I’d _prefer_ him; I’d give him preferences, the\r\nstubborn mule! What is it, sir, pray, that he _prefers_ not to do now?”\r\n\r\nBartleby moved not a limb.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Nippers,” said I, “I’d prefer that you would withdraw for the\r\npresent.”"

The\r\nheart of the eternal pyramids, it seemed, wherein, by some strange\r\nmagic, through the clefts, grass-seed, dropped by birds, had sprung.\r\n\r\nStrangely huddled at the base of the wall, his knees drawn up, and\r\nlying on his side, his head touching the cold stones, I saw the wasted\r\nBartleby. But nothing stirred. I paused; then went close up to him;\r\nstooped over, and saw that his dim eyes were open; otherwise he seemed\r\nprofoundly sleeping. Something prompted me to touch him. I felt his\r\nhand, when a tingling shiver ran up my arm and down my spine to my\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe round face of the grub-man peered upon me now. “His dinner is\r\nready.

And so I found\r\nhim there, standing all alone in the quietest of the yards, his face\r\ntowards a high wall, while all around, from the narrow slits of the\r\njail windows, I thought I saw peering out upon him the eyes of\r\nmurderers and thieves.\r\n\r\n“Bartleby!”\r\n\r\n“I know you,” he said, without looking round,—“and I want nothing to\r\nsay to you.”",
                "see you again.”\r\n\r\nSome few days after this, I again obtained admission to the Tombs, and\r\nwent through the corridors in quest of Bartleby; but without finding\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I saw him coming from his cell not long ago,” said a turnkey, “may be\r\nhe’s gone to loiter in the yards.”\r\n\r\nSo I went in that direction.\r\n\r\n“Are you looking for the silent man?” said another turnkey passing me.\r\n“Yonder he lies—sleeping in the yard there. ’Tis not twenty minutes\r\nsince I saw him lie down.”\r\n\r\nThe yard was entirely quiet. It was not accessible to the common\r\nprisoners. The surrounding walls, of amazing thickness, kept off all\r\nsounds behind them. The Egyptian character of the masonry weighed upon\r\nme with its gloom. But a soft imprisoned turf grew under foot. The",

Bartleby was not to be seen. I looked\r\nround anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that\r\nhe was gone. Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for\r\nan indefinite period Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my\r\noffice, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed. The cushioned seat\r\nof a rickety old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean,\r\nreclining form.

Seeking the right officer, I stated the\r\npurpose of my call, and was informed that the individual I described\r\nwas indeed within. I then assured the functionary that Bartleby was a\r\nperfectly honest man, and greatly to be compassionated, however\r\nunaccountably eccentric.

Nothing reproachful attaches to you by being here. And see, it\r\nis not so sad a place as one might think. Look, there is the sky, and\r\nhere is the grass.”\r\n\r\n“I know where I am,” he replied, but would say nothing more, and so I\r\nleft him.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the corridor again, a broad meat-like man, in an apron,\r\naccosted me, and jerking his thumb over his shoulder said—“Is that your\r\nfriend?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Does he want to starve? If he does, let him live on the prison fare,\r\nthat’s all.”\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” asked I, not knowing what to make of such an\r\nunofficially speaking person in such a place.",

The\r\nreport was this: that Bartleby had been a subordinate clerk in the Dead\r\nLetter Office at Washington, from which he had been suddenly removed by\r\na change in the administration.

I felt my most precious papers perfectly safe in his hands.\r\nSometimes to be sure I could not, for the very soul of me, avoid\r\nfalling into sudden spasmodic passions with him.

And more than all, I remembered a certain unconscious air of\r\npallid—how shall I call it?—of pallid haughtiness, say, or rather an\r\naustere reserve about him, which had positively awed me into my tame\r\ncompliance with his eccentricities, when I had feared to ask him to do\r\nthe slightest incidental thing for me, even though I might know, from",

Nevertheless, as he was in many ways a most\r\nvaluable person to me, and all the time before twelve o’clock,\r\nmeridian, was the quickest, steadiest creature too, accomplishing a\r\ngreat deal of work in a style not easy to be matched—for these reasons,\r\nI was willing to overlook his eccentricities, though indeed,",

I\r\nremembered that he never spoke but to answer; that though at intervals\r\nhe had considerable time to himself, yet I had never seen him\r\nreading—no, not even a newspaper; that for long periods he would stand\r\nlooking out, at his pale window behind the screen, upon the dead brick\r\nwall; I was quite sure he never visited any refectory or eating house;\r\nwhile his pale face clearly indicated that he never drank beer like",

I think his conduct quite\r\nunusual, and indeed unjust, as regards Turkey and myself. But it may\r\nonly be a passing whim.”",
                "angry spark from him answerable to my own. But indeed I might as well\r\nhave essayed to strike fire with my knuckles against a bit of Windsor\r\nsoap. But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the\r\nfollowing little scene ensued:\r\n\r\n“Bartleby,” said I, “when those papers are all copied, I will compare\r\nthem with you.”\r\n\r\n“I would prefer not to.”\r\n\r\n“How? Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?”\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nI threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Turkey and\r\nNippers, exclaimed in an excited manner—\r\n\r\n“He says, a second time, he won’t examine his papers. What do you think\r\nof it, Turkey?”\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon, be it remembered. Turkey sat glowing like a brass\r\nboiler, his bald head steaming, his hands reeling among his blotted\r\npapers.",
                "only be a passing whim.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed I, “you have strangely changed your mind then—you speak\r\nvery gently of him now.”\r\n\r\n“All beer,” cried Turkey; “gentleness is effects of beer—Nippers and I\r\ndined together to-day. You see how gentle _I_ am, sir. Shall I go and\r\nblack his eyes?”\r\n\r\n“You refer to Bartleby, I suppose. No, not to-day, Turkey,” I replied;\r\n“pray, put up your fists.”\r\n\r\nI closed the doors, and again advanced towards Bartleby. I felt\r\nadditional incentives tempting me to my fate. I burned to be rebelled\r\nagainst again. I remembered that Bartleby never left the office.\r\n\r\n“Bartleby,” said I, “Ginger Nut is away; just step round to the Post\r\nOffice, won’t you? (it was but a three minute walk,) and see if there\r\nis any thing for me.”\r\n\r\n“I would prefer not to.”",
                "twelve o’clock came; Turkey began to glow in the face, overturn his\r\ninkstand, and become generally obstreperous; Nippers abated down into\r\nquietude and courtesy; Ginger Nut munched his noon apple; and Bartleby\r\nremained standing at his window in one of his profoundest dead-wall\r\nreveries. Will it be credited? Ought I to acknowledge it? That\r\nafternoon I left the office without saying one further word to him.\r\n\r\nSome days now passed, during which, at leisure intervals I looked a\r\nlittle into “Edwards on the Will,” and “Priestly on Necessity.” Under\r\nthe circumstances, those books induced a salutary feeling. Gradually I\r\nslid into the persuasion that these troubles of mine touching the\r\nscrivener, had been all predestinated from eternity, and Bartleby was",
                "present.”\r\n\r\nSomehow, of late I had got into the way of involuntarily using this\r\nword “prefer” upon all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions. And I\r\ntrembled to think that my contact with the scrivener had already and\r\nseriously affected me in a mental way. And what further and deeper\r\naberration might it not yet produce? This apprehension had not been\r\nwithout efficacy in determining me to summary means.\r\n\r\nAs Nippers, looking very sour and sulky, was departing, Turkey blandly\r\nand deferentially approached.\r\n\r\n“With submission, sir,” said he, “yesterday I was thinking about\r\nBartleby here, and I think that if he would but prefer to take a quart\r\nof good ale every day, it would do much towards mending him, and\r\nenabling him to assist in examining his papers.”",
                "very kindly, that perhaps now that he was growing old, it might be well\r\nto abridge his labors; in short, he need not come to my chambers after\r\ntwelve o’clock, but, dinner over, had best go home to his lodgings and\r\nrest himself till teatime. But no; he insisted upon his afternoon\r\ndevotions. His countenance became intolerably fervid, as he\r\noratorically assured me—gesticulating with a long ruler at the other\r\nend of the room—that if his services in the morning were useful, how\r\nindispensable, then, in the afternoon?\r\n\r\n“With submission, sir,” said Turkey on this occasion, “I consider\r\nmyself your right-hand man. In the morning I but marshal and deploy my\r\ncolumns; but in the afternoon I put myself at their head, and gallantly",

I never use it myself. But, sir, as I\r\nwas saying, if he would but prefer—”\r\n\r\n“Turkey,” interrupted I, “you will please withdraw.”\r\n\r\n“Oh certainly, sir, if you prefer that I should.”\r\n\r\nAs he opened the folding-door to retire, Nippers at his desk caught a",

It became necessary to examine them. It was an important\r\nsuit, and great accuracy was imperative. Having all things arranged I\r\ncalled Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut from the next room, meaning to\r\nplace the four copies in the hands of my four clerks, while I should\r\nread from the original. Accordingly Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut had\r\ntaken their seats in a row, each with his document in hand, when I\r\ncalled to Bartleby to join this interesting group.\r\n\r\n“Bartleby! quick, I am waiting.”\r\n\r\nI heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted floor, and",

I remembered the tragedy of the unfortunate\r\nAdams and the still more unfortunate Colt in the solitary office of the\r\nlatter; and how poor Colt, being dreadfully incensed by Adams, and\r\nimprudently permitting himself to get wildly excited, was at unawares\r\nhurried into his fatal act—an act which certainly no man could possibly",

These may seem\r\nnames, the like of which are not usually found in the Directory. In\r\ntruth they were nicknames, mutually conferred upon each other by my\r\nthree clerks, and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or\r\ncharacters.

His late remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly. I\r\nobserved that he never went to dinner; indeed that he never went any\r\nwhere. As yet I had never of my personal knowledge known him to be\r\noutside of my office. He was a perpetual sentry in the corner.

Immediately then the thought came sweeping across\r\nme, What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed! His\r\npoverty is great; but his solitude, how horrible! Think of it. Of a\r\nSunday, Wall-street is deserted as Petra; and every night of every day\r\nit is an emptiness. This building too, which of week-days hums with\r\nindustry and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all\r\nthrough Sunday is forlorn.

Indeed, to this quick-witted youth the whole noble\r\nscience of the law was contained in a nut-shell. Not the least among\r\nthe employments of Ginger Nut, as well as one which he discharged with\r\nthe most alacrity, was his duty as cake and apple purveyor for Turkey\r\nand Nippers.

I mean\r\nto try it, little by little.\r\n\r\nI have found out another funny thing, but I shan’t tell it this time!\r\nIt does not do to trust people too much.\r\n\r\nThere are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John\r\nis beginning to notice. I don’t like the look in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me.\r\nShe had a very good report to give.\r\n\r\nShe said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\r\n\r\nJohn knows I don’t sleep very well at night, for all I’m so quiet!",
                "of me! I must not let her find me writing.\r\n\r\nShe is a perfect, and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better\r\nprofession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me\r\nsick!\r\n\r\nBut I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nThere is one that commands the road, a lovely, shaded, winding road,\r\nand one that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too,\r\nfull of great elms and velvet meadows.\r\n\r\nThis wallpaper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a\r\nparticularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights,\r\nand not clearly then.\r\n\r\nBut in the places where it isn’t faded, and where the sun is just so, I\r\ncan see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to",
                "keep watch of it all the same.\r\n\r\nThere are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.\r\n\r\nBehind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.\r\n\r\nIt is always the same shape, only very numerous.\r\n\r\nAnd it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that\r\npattern. I don’t like it a bit. I wonder—I begin to think—I wish John\r\nwould take me away from here!\r\n\r\nIt is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise,\r\nand because he loves me so.\r\n\r\nBut I tried it last night.\r\n\r\nIt was moonlight. The moon shines in all around, just as the sun does.\r\n\r\nI hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by\r\none window or another.\r\n\r\nJohn was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched",
                "derision!\r\n\r\nI am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the\r\nwindow would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nBesides I wouldn’t do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step\r\nlike that is improper and might be misconstrued.\r\n\r\nI don’t like to look out of the windows even—there are so many of those\r\ncreeping women, and they creep so fast.\r\n\r\nI wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as I did?\r\n\r\nBut I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope—you don’t get me\r\nout in the road there!\r\n\r\nI suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes\r\nnight, and that is hard!\r\n\r\nIt is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I\r\nplease!",

John says it is good for me, and to sleep\r\nall I can.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after\r\neach meal.\r\n\r\nIt is a very bad habit, I am convinced, for, you see, I don’t sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd that cultivates deceit, for I don’t tell them I’m awake,—oh, no!",

I mean\r\nto try it, little by little.\r\n\r\nI have found out another funny thing, but I shan’t tell it this time!\r\nIt does not do to trust people too much.\r\n\r\nThere are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John\r\nis beginning to notice. I don’t like the look in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me.\r\nShe had a very good report to give.\r\n\r\nShe said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\r\n\r\nJohn knows I don’t sleep very well at night, for all I’m so quiet!",

This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town\r\nover night, and won’t be out until this evening.\r\n\r\nJennie wanted to sleep with me—the sly thing! but I told her I should\r\nundoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.\r\n\r\nThat was clever, for really I wasn’t alone a bit! As soon as it was\r\nmoonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I\r\ngot up and ran to help her."

But I know she was studying that pattern,\r\nand I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!\r\n\r\nLife is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have\r\nsomething more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat\r\nbetter, and am more quiet than I was.\r\n\r\nJohn is so pleased to see me improve!

To jump out of the\r\nwindow would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nBesides I wouldn’t do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step\r\nlike that is improper and might be misconstrued.\r\n\r\nI don’t like to look out of the windows even—there are so many of those\r\ncreeping women, and they creep so fast.\r\n\r\nI wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as I did?\r\n\r\nBut I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope—you don’t get me\r\nout in the road there!\r\n\r\nI suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes\r\nnight, and that is hard!\r\n\r\nIt is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I\r\nplease!",

I won’t, even if Jennie asks me to.\r\n\r\nFor outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green\r\ninstead of yellow.\r\n\r\nBut here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits\r\nin that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.\r\n\r\nWhy, there’s John at the door!\r\n\r\nIt is no use, young man, you can’t open it!\r\n\r\nHow he does call and pound!\r\n\r\nNow he’s crying for an axe.\r\n\r\nIt would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!\r\n\r\n“John dear!” said I in the gentlest voice, “the key is down by the\r\nfront steps, under a plantain leaf!”\r\n\r\nThat silenced him for a few moments.\r\n\r\nThen he said—very quietly indeed, “Open the door, my darling!”\r\n\r\n“I can’t,” said I. “The key is down by the front door under a plantain"

He laughed a little the other\r\nday, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wallpaper.",
                "At night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamplight, and\r\nworst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars! The outside pattern I mean,\r\nand the woman behind it is as plain as can be.\r\n\r\nI didn’t realize for a long time what the thing was that showed\r\nbehind,—that dim sub-pattern,—but now I am quite sure it is a woman.\r\n\r\nBy daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps\r\nher so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.\r\n\r\nI lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep\r\nall I can.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after\r\neach meal.\r\n\r\nIt is a very bad habit, I am convinced, for, you see, I don’t sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd that cultivates deceit, for I don’t tell them I’m awake,—oh, no!",
                "It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my\r\nwork. When I get really well John says we will ask Cousin Henry and\r\nJulia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put\r\nfire-works in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people\r\nabout now.\r\n\r\nI wish I could get well faster.\r\n\r\nBut I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew\r\nwhat a vicious influence it had!\r\n\r\nThere is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck\r\nand two bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down.\r\n\r\nI get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the\r\neverlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd,\r\nunblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths",
                "John was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched\r\nthe moonlight on that undulating wallpaper till I felt creepy.\r\n\r\nThe faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she\r\nwanted to get out.\r\n\r\nI got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move, and\r\nwhen I came back John was awake.\r\n\r\n“What is it, little girl?” he said. “Don’t go walking about like\r\nthat—you’ll get cold.”\r\n\r\nI thought it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was\r\nnot gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.\r\n\r\n“Why darling!” said he, “our lease will be up in three weeks, and I\r\ncan’t see how to leave before.\r\n\r\n“The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town",
                "derision!\r\n\r\nI am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the\r\nwindow would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nBesides I wouldn’t do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step\r\nlike that is improper and might be misconstrued.\r\n\r\nI don’t like to look out of the windows even—there are so many of those\r\ncreeping women, and they creep so fast.\r\n\r\nI wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as I did?\r\n\r\nBut I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope—you don’t get me\r\nout in the road there!\r\n\r\nI suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes\r\nnight, and that is hard!\r\n\r\nIt is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I\r\nplease!",

What a fortunate\r\nescape! Why, I wouldn’t have a child of mine, an impressionable little\r\nthing, live in such a room for worlds.\r\n\r\nI never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here\r\nafter all. I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.\r\n\r\nOf course I never mention it to them any more,—I am too wise,—but I\r\nkeep watch of it all the same.",
                "I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.\r\n\r\nI don’t want to go out, and I don’t want to have anybody come in, till\r\nJohn comes.\r\n\r\nI want to astonish him.\r\n\r\nI’ve got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman\r\ndoes get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!\r\n\r\nBut I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!\r\n\r\nThis bed will not move!\r\n\r\nI tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I\r\nbit off a little piece at one corner—but it hurt my teeth.\r\n\r\nThen I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It\r\nsticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled\r\nheads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with\r\nderision!",
                "keep watch of it all the same.\r\n\r\nThere are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.\r\n\r\nBehind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.\r\n\r\nIt is always the same shape, only very numerous.\r\n\r\nAnd it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that\r\npattern. I don’t like it a bit. I wonder—I begin to think—I wish John\r\nwould take me away from here!\r\n\r\nIt is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise,\r\nand because he loves me so.\r\n\r\nBut I tried it last night.\r\n\r\nIt was moonlight. The moon shines in all around, just as the sun does.\r\n\r\nI hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by\r\none window or another.\r\n\r\nJohn was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched",
                "And though I always see her she may be able to creep faster than I can\r\nturn!\r\n\r\nI have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as\r\nfast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.\r\n\r\nIf only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean\r\nto try it, little by little.\r\n\r\nI have found out another funny thing, but I shan’t tell it this time!\r\nIt does not do to trust people too much.\r\n\r\nThere are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John\r\nis beginning to notice. I don’t like the look in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me.\r\nShe had a very good report to give.\r\n\r\nShe said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\r\n\r\nJohn knows I don’t sleep very well at night, for all I’m so quiet!"

John is to stay in town\r\nover night, and won’t be out until this evening.\r\n\r\nJennie wanted to sleep with me—the sly thing! but I told her I should\r\nundoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.\r\n\r\nThat was clever, for really I wasn’t alone a bit! As soon as it was\r\nmoonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I\r\ngot up and ran to help her.",
                "John was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched\r\nthe moonlight on that undulating wallpaper till I felt creepy.\r\n\r\nThe faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she\r\nwanted to get out.\r\n\r\nI got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move, and\r\nwhen I came back John was awake.\r\n\r\n“What is it, little girl?” he said. “Don’t go walking about like\r\nthat—you’ll get cold.”\r\n\r\nI thought it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was\r\nnot gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.\r\n\r\n“Why darling!” said he, “our lease will be up in three weeks, and I\r\ncan’t see how to leave before.\r\n\r\n“The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town",
                "The furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for\r\nwe had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used as\r\na playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I\r\nnever saw such ravages as the children have made here.\r\n\r\nThe wallpaper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh\r\ncloser than a brother—they must have had perseverance as well as\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\nThen the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster\r\nitself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed, which is\r\nall we found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.\r\n\r\nBut I don’t mind it a bit—only the paper.\r\n\r\nThere comes John’s sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful\r\nof me! I must not let her find me writing.",
                "And though I always see her she may be able to creep faster than I can\r\nturn!\r\n\r\nI have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as\r\nfast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.\r\n\r\nIf only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean\r\nto try it, little by little.\r\n\r\nI have found out another funny thing, but I shan’t tell it this time!\r\nIt does not do to trust people too much.\r\n\r\nThere are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John\r\nis beginning to notice. I don’t like the look in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me.\r\nShe had a very good report to give.\r\n\r\nShe said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\r\n\r\nJohn knows I don’t sleep very well at night, for all I’m so quiet!",
                "was doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught\r\nstealing, and looked quite angry—asked me why I should frighten her so!\r\n\r\nThen she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she\r\nhad found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John’s, and she wished\r\nwe would be more careful!\r\n\r\nDid not that sound innocent? But I know she was studying that pattern,\r\nand I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!\r\n\r\nLife is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have\r\nsomething more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat\r\nbetter, and am more quiet than I was.\r\n\r\nJohn is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other\r\nday, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wallpaper.",
                "got up and ran to help her.\r\n\r\nI pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we\r\nhad peeled off yards of that paper.\r\n\r\nA strip about as high as my head and half around the room.\r\n\r\nAnd then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me\r\nI declared I would finish it to-day!\r\n\r\nWe go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again\r\nto leave things as they were before.\r\n\r\nJennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I\r\ndid it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and said she wouldn’t mind doing it herself, but I must not\r\nget tired.\r\n\r\nHow she betrayed herself that time!\r\n\r\nBut I am here, and no person touches this paper but me—not alive!",
                "At night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamplight, and\r\nworst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars! The outside pattern I mean,\r\nand the woman behind it is as plain as can be.\r\n\r\nI didn’t realize for a long time what the thing was that showed\r\nbehind,—that dim sub-pattern,—but now I am quite sure it is a woman.\r\n\r\nBy daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps\r\nher so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.\r\n\r\nI lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep\r\nall I can.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after\r\neach meal.\r\n\r\nIt is a very bad habit, I am convinced, for, you see, I don’t sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd that cultivates deceit, for I don’t tell them I’m awake,—oh, no!",
                "I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.\r\n\r\nI don’t want to go out, and I don’t want to have anybody come in, till\r\nJohn comes.\r\n\r\nI want to astonish him.\r\n\r\nI’ve got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman\r\ndoes get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!\r\n\r\nBut I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!\r\n\r\nThis bed will not move!\r\n\r\nI tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I\r\nbit off a little piece at one corner—but it hurt my teeth.\r\n\r\nThen I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It\r\nsticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled\r\nheads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with\r\nderision!",
                "keep watch of it all the same.\r\n\r\nThere are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.\r\n\r\nBehind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.\r\n\r\nIt is always the same shape, only very numerous.\r\n\r\nAnd it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that\r\npattern. I don’t like it a bit. I wonder—I begin to think—I wish John\r\nwould take me away from here!\r\n\r\nIt is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise,\r\nand because he loves me so.\r\n\r\nBut I tried it last night.\r\n\r\nIt was moonlight. The moon shines in all around, just as the sun does.\r\n\r\nI hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by\r\none window or another.\r\n\r\nJohn was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched"

This worried me very much. And as the idea came upon me of\r\nhis possibly turning out a long-lived man, and keep occupying my\r\nchambers, and denying my authority; and perplexing my visitors; and\r\nscandalizing my professional reputation; and casting a general gloom\r\nover the premises; keeping soul and body together to the last upon his\r\nsavings (for doubtless he spent but half a dime a day), and in the end\r\nperhaps outlive me, and claim possession of my office by right of his\r\nperpetual occupancy: as all these dark anticipations crowded upon me",

Within\r\nthree feet of the panes was a wall, and the light came down from far\r\nabove, between two lofty buildings, as from a very small opening in a\r\ndome. Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I procured a high\r\ngreen folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby from my\r\nsight, though not remove him from my voice.

According to my humor I threw open these doors, or\r\nclosed them. I resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the\r\nfolding-doors, but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man\r\nwithin easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be done.

According to my humor I threw open these doors, or\r\nclosed them. I resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the\r\nfolding-doors, but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man\r\nwithin easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be done. I placed\r\nhis desk close up to a small side-window in that part of the room, a",

Within\r\nthree feet of the panes was a wall, and the light came down from far\r\nabove, between two lofty buildings, as from a very small opening in a\r\ndome. Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I procured a high\r\ngreen folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby from my\r\nsight, though not remove him from my voice.

I resolved to gather all my faculties together, and for ever rid me\r\nof this intolerable incubus.\r\n\r\nEre revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I\r\nfirst simply suggested to Bartleby the propriety of his permanent\r\ndeparture. In a calm and serious tone, I commended the idea to his\r\ncareful and mature consideration. But having taken three days to\r\nmeditate upon it, he apprised me that his original determination\r\nremained the same; in short, that he still preferred to abide with me.",

At length,\r\nnecessities connected with my business tyrannized over all other\r\nconsiderations. Decently as I could, I told Bartleby that in six days’\r\ntime he must unconditionally leave the office. I warned him to take\r\nmeasures, in the interval, for procuring some other abode. I offered to\r\nassist him in this endeavor, if he himself would but take the first\r\nstep towards a removal. “And when you finally quit me, Bartleby,” added\r\nI, “I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided. Six days from\r\nthis hour, remember.”\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of that period, I peeped behind the screen, and lo!\r\nBartleby was there.",

He had\r\nfrequently restored to me sixpences and shillings carelessly dropped\r\nupon the floor, for I am apt to be very reckless in such shirt-button\r\naffairs. The proceeding then which followed will not be deemed\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\n“Bartleby,” said I, “I owe you twelve dollars on account; here are\r\nthirty-two; the odd twenty are yours.—Will you take it?” and I handed\r\nthe bills towards him.",

At last, familiarly drawing my chair behind his\r\nscreen, I sat down and said: “Bartleby, never mind then about revealing\r\nyour history; but let me entreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as\r\nmay be with the usages of this office. Say now you will help to examine\r\npapers to-morrow or next day: in short, say now that in a day or two",

At last, familiarly drawing my chair behind his\r\nscreen, I sat down and said: “Bartleby, never mind then about revealing\r\nyour history; but let me entreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as\r\nmay be with the usages of this office.

And I\r\ntrembled to think that my contact with the scrivener had already and\r\nseriously affected me in a mental way. And what further and deeper\r\naberration might it not yet produce? This apprehension had not been\r\nwithout efficacy in determining me to summary means.\r\n\r\nAs Nippers, looking very sour and sulky, was departing, Turkey blandly\r\nand deferentially approached.\r\n\r\n“With submission, sir,” said he, “yesterday I was thinking about\r\nBartleby here, and I think that if he would but prefer to take a quart\r\nof good ale every day, it would do much towards mending him, and\r\nenabling him to assist in examining his papers.”",

He was hurrying away to make good his promise, when I\r\ndetained him, alarmed at the effect of incautiously rousing Turkey’s\r\ncombativeness after dinner.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Turkey,” said I, “and hear what Nippers has to say. What do\r\nyou think of it, Nippers? Would I not be justified in immediately\r\ndismissing Bartleby?”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, that is for you to decide, sir. I think his conduct quite\r\nunusual, and indeed unjust, as regards Turkey and myself. But it may\r\nonly be a passing whim.”",
                "only be a passing whim.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed I, “you have strangely changed your mind then—you speak\r\nvery gently of him now.”\r\n\r\n“All beer,” cried Turkey; “gentleness is effects of beer—Nippers and I\r\ndined together to-day. You see how gentle _I_ am, sir. Shall I go and\r\nblack his eyes?”\r\n\r\n“You refer to Bartleby, I suppose. No, not to-day, Turkey,” I replied;\r\n“pray, put up your fists.”\r\n\r\nI closed the doors, and again advanced towards Bartleby. I felt\r\nadditional incentives tempting me to my fate. I burned to be rebelled\r\nagainst again. I remembered that Bartleby never left the office.\r\n\r\n“Bartleby,” said I, “Ginger Nut is away; just step round to the Post\r\nOffice, won’t you? (it was but a three minute walk,) and see if there\r\nis any thing for me.”\r\n\r\n“I would prefer not to.”",
                "enabling him to assist in examining his papers.”\r\n\r\n“So you have got the word too,” said I, slightly excited.\r\n\r\n“With submission, what word, sir,” asked Turkey, respectfully crowding\r\nhimself into the contracted space behind the screen, and by so doing,\r\nmaking me jostle the scrivener. “What word, sir?”\r\n\r\n“I would prefer to be left alone here,” said Bartleby, as if offended\r\nat being mobbed in his privacy.\r\n\r\n“_That’s_ the word, Turkey,” said I—“that’s it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, _prefer_? oh yes—queer word. I never use it myself. But, sir, as I\r\nwas saying, if he would but prefer—”\r\n\r\n“Turkey,” interrupted I, “you will please withdraw.”\r\n\r\n“Oh certainly, sir, if you prefer that I should.”\r\n\r\nAs he opened the folding-door to retire, Nippers at his desk caught a",

Poor fellow, poor\r\nfellow! thought I, he don’t mean any thing; and besides, he has seen\r\nhard times, and ought to be indulged.\r\n\r\nI endeavored also immediately to occupy myself, and at the same time to\r\ncomfort my despondency. I tried to fancy that in the course of the\r\nmorning, at such time as might prove agreeable to him, Bartleby, of his\r\nown free accord, would emerge from his hermitage, and take up some\r\ndecided line of march in the direction of the door. But no. Half-past\r\ntwelve o’clock came; Turkey began to glow in the face, overturn his",

But one afternoon the evil impulse in me mastered me, and the\r\nfollowing little scene ensued:\r\n\r\n“Bartleby,” said I, “when those papers are all copied, I will compare\r\nthem with you.”\r\n\r\n“I would prefer not to.”\r\n\r\n“How? Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?”\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nI threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Turkey and\r\nNippers, exclaimed in an excited manner—\r\n\r\n“He says, a second time, he won’t examine his papers. What do you think\r\nof it, Turkey?”\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon, be it remembered. Turkey sat glowing like a brass\r\nboiler, his bald head steaming, his hands reeling among his blotted\r\npapers.",
                "It is a very dull, wearisome, and lethargic affair. I can readily\r\nimagine that to some sanguine temperaments it would be altogether\r\nintolerable. For example, I cannot credit that the mettlesome poet\r\nByron would have contentedly sat down with Bartleby to examine a law\r\ndocument of, say five hundred pages, closely written in a crimpy hand.\r\n\r\nNow and then, in the haste of business, it had been my habit to assist\r\nin comparing some brief document myself, calling Turkey or Nippers for\r\nthis purpose. One object I had in placing Bartleby so handy to me\r\nbehind the screen, was to avail myself of his services on such trivial\r\noccasions. It was on the third day, I think, of his being with me, and\r\nbefore any necessity had arisen for having his own writing examined,",
                "After a few words touching his qualifications, I engaged him, glad to\r\nhave among my corps of copyists a man of so singularly sedate an\r\naspect, which I thought might operate beneficially upon the flighty\r\ntemper of Turkey, and the fiery one of Nippers.\r\n\r\nI should have stated before that ground glass folding-doors divided my\r\npremises into two parts, one of which was occupied by my scriveners,\r\nthe other by myself. According to my humor I threw open these doors, or\r\nclosed them. I resolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the\r\nfolding-doors, but on my side of them, so as to have this quiet man\r\nwithin easy call, in case any trifling thing was to be done. I placed\r\nhis desk close up to a small side-window in that part of the room, a",

Owing to the great height of the surrounding buildings, and my\r\nchambers being on the second floor, the interval between this wall and\r\nmine not a little resembled a huge square cistern.\r\n\r\nAt the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby, I had two persons\r\nas copyists in my employment, and a promising lad as an office-boy.\r\nFirst, Turkey; second, Nippers; third, Ginger Nut. These may seem\r\nnames, the like of which are not usually found in the Directory. In\r\ntruth they were nicknames, mutually conferred upon each other by my\r\nthree clerks, and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or\r\ncharacters.

I repeated my request in the\r\nclearest tone I could assume. But in quite as clear a one came the\r\nprevious reply, “I would prefer not to.”\r\n\r\n“Prefer not to,” echoed I, rising in high excitement, and crossing the\r\nroom with a stride. “What do you mean?

At last, familiarly drawing my chair behind his\r\nscreen, I sat down and said: “Bartleby, never mind then about revealing\r\nyour history; but let me entreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as\r\nmay be with the usages of this office.

As soon as tranquility returned I distinctly perceived\r\nthat I had now done all that I possibly could, both in respect to the\r\ndemands of the landlord and his tenants, and with regard to my own\r\ndesire and sense of duty, to benefit Bartleby, and shield him from rude\r\npersecution.

There was now great work\r\nfor scriveners. Not only must I push the clerks already with me, but I\r\nmust have additional help. In answer to my advertisement, a motionless\r\nyoung man one morning, stood upon my office threshold, the door being\r\nopen, for it was summer. I can see that figure now—pallidly neat,\r\npitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was Bartleby.\r\n\r\nAfter a few words touching his qualifications, I engaged him, glad to",

                "Now, the utterly unsurmised appearance of Bartleby, tenanting my\r\nlaw-chambers of a Sunday morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly\r\n_nonchalance_, yet withal firm and self-possessed, had such a strange\r\neffect upon me, that incontinently I slunk away from my own door, and\r\ndid as desired. But not without sundry twinges of impotent rebellion\r\nagainst the mild effrontery of this unaccountable scrivener. Indeed, it\r\nwas his wonderful mildness chiefly, which not only disarmed me, but\r\nunmanned me, as it were. For I consider that one, for the time, is a\r\nsort of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired clerk to dictate\r\nto him, and order him away from his own premises.

Even so, for the\r\nmost part, I regarded Bartleby and his ways.

Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for\r\nan indefinite period Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my\r\noffice, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed. The cushioned seat\r\nof a rickety old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean,\r\nreclining form. Rolled away under his desk, I found a blanket; under\r\nthe empty grate, a blacking box and brush; on a chair, a tin basin,\r\nwith soap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of",

But I thought it prudent not to break the dismission\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nThe next day I noticed that Bartleby did nothing but stand at his\r\nwindow in his dead-wall revery.

But inasmuch as this vague report has not been\r\nwithout certain strange suggestive interest to me, however sad, it may\r\nprove the same with some others; and so I will briefly mention it. The\r\nreport was this: that Bartleby had been a subordinate clerk in the Dead\r\nLetter Office at Washington, from which he had been suddenly removed by\r\na change in the administration. When I think over this rumor, I cannot\r\nadequately express the emotions which seize me. Dead letters! does it\r\nnot sound like dead men? Conceive a man by nature and misfortune prone",

But he blankly declined. So,\r\nmuch to my inconvenience, I went myself.\r\n\r\nStill added days went by. Whether Bartleby’s eyes improved or not, I\r\ncould not say. To all appearance, I thought they did. But when I asked\r\nhim if they did, he vouchsafed no answer. At all events, he would do no\r\ncopying. At last, in reply to my urgings, he informed me that he had\r\npermanently given up copying.\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed I; “suppose your eyes should get entirely well—better\r\nthan ever before—would you not copy then?”",

Before, I had never experienced aught but a\r\nnot-unpleasing sadness. The bond of a common humanity now drew me\r\nirresistibly to gloom. A fraternal melancholy! For both I and Bartleby\r\nwere sons of Adam. I remembered the bright silks and sparkling faces I\r\nhad seen that day, in gala trim, swan-like sailing down the Mississippi\r\nof Broadway; and I contrasted them with the pallid copyist, and thought\r\nto myself, Ah, happiness courts the light, so we deem the world is gay;\r\nbut misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none.

But ere parting with the reader, let me say, that if this\r\nlittle narrative has sufficiently interested him, to awaken curiosity\r\nas to who Bartleby was, and what manner of life he led prior to the\r\npresent narrator’s making his acquaintance, I can only reply, that in\r\nsuch curiosity I fully share, but am wholly unable to gratify it.

Bartleby was not to be seen. I looked\r\nround anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that\r\nhe was gone. Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for\r\nan indefinite period Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my\r\noffice, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed. The cushioned seat\r\nof a rickety old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean,\r\nreclining form.

The\r\nscrivener’s pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring\r\nstrangers, in its shivering winding sheet.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I was attracted by Bartleby’s closed desk, the key in open\r\nsight left in the lock.\r\n\r\nI mean no mischief, seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity,\r\nthought I; besides, the desk is mine, and its contents too, so I will\r\nmake bold to look within.

One object I had in placing Bartleby so handy to me\r\nbehind the screen, was to avail myself of his services on such trivial\r\noccasions.

Immediately then the thought came sweeping across\r\nme, What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed! His\r\npoverty is great; but his solitude, how horrible! Think of it. Of a\r\nSunday, Wall-street is deserted as Petra; and every night of every day\r\nit is an emptiness.

Just this\r\nnervous weakness, I suppose.\r\n\r\nAnd dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs\r\nand laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHe said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I\r\nmust take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.",

Really, dear, you are better!”\r\n\r\n“Better in body perhaps”—I began, and stopped short, for he sat up\r\nstraight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I\r\ncould not say another word.\r\n\r\n“My darling,” said he, “I beg of you, for my sake and for our child’s\r\nsake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let\r\nthat idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so\r\nfascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish\r\nfancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?”",

Of course if you were in any danger I could and would, but\r\nyou really are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a\r\ndoctor, dear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your\r\nappetite is better. I feel really much easier about you.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t weigh a bit more,” said I, “nor as much; and my appetite may\r\nbe better in the evening, when you are here, but it is worse in the\r\nmorning when you are away.”\r\n\r\n“Bless her little heart!” said he with a big hug; “she shall be as sick\r\nas she pleases! But now let’s improve the shining hours by going to\r\nsleep, and talk about it in the morning!”\r\n\r\n“And you won’t go away?” I asked gloomily.",

I’m sure I never used to\r\nbe so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.\r\n\r\nBut John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I\r\ntake pains to control myself,—before him, at least,—and that makes me\r\nvery tired.\r\n\r\nI don’t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the\r\npiazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned\r\nchintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.\r\n\r\nHe said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no",

The woman behind shakes it!\r\n\r\nSometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes\r\nonly one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThen in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady\r\nspots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.\r\n\r\nAnd she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb",
                "John was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched\r\nthe moonlight on that undulating wallpaper till I felt creepy.\r\n\r\nThe faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she\r\nwanted to get out.\r\n\r\nI got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move, and\r\nwhen I came back John was awake.\r\n\r\n“What is it, little girl?” he said. “Don’t go walking about like\r\nthat—you’ll get cold.”\r\n\r\nI thought it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was\r\nnot gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.\r\n\r\n“Why darling!” said he, “our lease will be up in three weeks, and I\r\ncan’t see how to leave before.\r\n\r\n“The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town",
                "keep watch of it all the same.\r\n\r\nThere are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.\r\n\r\nBehind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.\r\n\r\nIt is always the same shape, only very numerous.\r\n\r\nAnd it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that\r\npattern. I don’t like it a bit. I wonder—I begin to think—I wish John\r\nwould take me away from here!\r\n\r\nIt is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise,\r\nand because he loves me so.\r\n\r\nBut I tried it last night.\r\n\r\nIt was moonlight. The moon shines in all around, just as the sun does.\r\n\r\nI hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by\r\none window or another.\r\n\r\nJohn was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched",
                "At night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamplight, and\r\nworst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars! The outside pattern I mean,\r\nand the woman behind it is as plain as can be.\r\n\r\nI didn’t realize for a long time what the thing was that showed\r\nbehind,—that dim sub-pattern,—but now I am quite sure it is a woman.\r\n\r\nBy daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps\r\nher so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.\r\n\r\nI lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep\r\nall I can.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after\r\neach meal.\r\n\r\nIt is a very bad habit, I am convinced, for, you see, I don’t sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd that cultivates deceit, for I don’t tell them I’m awake,—oh, no!",
                "John knows I don’t sleep very well at night, for all I’m so quiet!\r\n\r\nHe asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very\r\nloving and kind.\r\n\r\nAs if I couldn’t see through him!\r\n\r\nStill, I don’t wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIt only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly\r\naffected by it.\r\n\r\nHurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town\r\nover night, and won’t be out until this evening.\r\n\r\nJennie wanted to sleep with me—the sly thing! but I told her I should\r\nundoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.\r\n\r\nThat was clever, for really I wasn’t alone a bit! As soon as it was\r\nmoonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I\r\ngot up and ran to help her.",
                "And she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb\r\nthrough that pattern—it strangles so; I think that is why it has so\r\nmany heads.\r\n\r\nThey get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns\r\nthem upside-down, and makes their eyes white!\r\n\r\nIf those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.\r\n\r\nI think that woman gets out in the daytime!\r\n\r\nAnd I’ll tell you why—privately—I’ve seen her!\r\n\r\nI can see her out of every one of my windows!\r\n\r\nIt is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most\r\nwomen do not creep by daylight.\r\n\r\nI see her on that long shaded lane, creeping up and down. I see her in\r\nthose dark grape arbors, creeping all around the garden.",
                "derision!\r\n\r\nI am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the\r\nwindow would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nBesides I wouldn’t do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step\r\nlike that is improper and might be misconstrued.\r\n\r\nI don’t like to look out of the windows even—there are so many of those\r\ncreeping women, and they creep so fast.\r\n\r\nI wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as I did?\r\n\r\nBut I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope—you don’t get me\r\nout in the road there!\r\n\r\nI suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes\r\nnight, and that is hard!\r\n\r\nIt is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I\r\nplease!",
                "fancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?”\r\n\r\nSo of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before\r\nlong. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn’t,—I lay there for\r\nhours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern\r\nreally did move together or separately.\r\n\r\nOn a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a\r\ndefiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind.\r\n\r\nThe color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating\r\nenough, but the pattern is torturing.\r\n\r\nYou think you have mastered it, but just as you get well under way in\r\nfollowing, it turns a back somersault and there you are. It slaps you\r\nin the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad\r\ndream.",
                "dream.\r\n\r\nThe outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus.\r\nIf you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of\r\ntoadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions,—why, that is\r\nsomething like it.\r\n\r\nThat is, sometimes!\r\n\r\nThere is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems\r\nto notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun shoots in through the east window—I always watch for that\r\nfirst long, straight ray—it changes so quickly that I never can quite\r\nbelieve it.\r\n\r\nThat is why I watch it always.\r\n\r\nBy moonlight—the moon shines in all night when there is a moon—I\r\nwouldn’t know it was the same paper.\r\n\r\nAt night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamplight, and",

He laughs at me so about\r\nthis wallpaper!\r\n\r\nAt first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I\r\nwas letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a\r\nnervous patient than to give way to such fancies.\r\n\r\nHe said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy\r\nbedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head\r\nof the stairs, and so on.\r\n\r\n“You know the place is doing you good,” he said, “and really, dear, I\r\ndon’t care to renovate the house just for a three months’ rental.”\r\n\r\n“Then do let us go downstairs,” I said, “there are such pretty rooms\r\nthere.”",

Just this\r\nnervous weakness, I suppose.\r\n\r\nAnd dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs\r\nand laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHe said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I\r\nmust take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.",
                "That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don’t care—there is\r\nsomething strange about the house—I can feel it.\r\n\r\nI even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt\r\nwas a draught, and shut the window.\r\n\r\nI get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I’m sure I never used to\r\nbe so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.\r\n\r\nBut John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I\r\ntake pains to control myself,—before him, at least,—and that makes me\r\nvery tired.\r\n\r\nI don’t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the\r\npiazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned\r\nchintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.\r\n\r\nHe said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no",
                "He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no\r\nnear room for him if he took another.\r\n\r\nHe is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nI have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all\r\ncare from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.\r\n\r\nHe said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect\r\nrest and all the air I could get. “Your exercise depends on your\r\nstrength, my dear,” said he, “and your food somewhat on your appetite;\r\nbut air you can absorb all the time.” So we took the nursery, at the\r\ntop of the house.\r\n\r\nIt is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look\r\nall ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then",
                "So I take phosphates or phosphites—whichever it is, and tonics, and\r\njourneys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to “work”\r\nuntil I am well again.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I disagree with their ideas.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change,\r\nwould do me good.\r\n\r\nBut what is one to do?\r\n\r\nI did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good\r\ndeal—having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.\r\n\r\nI sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and\r\nmore society and stimulus—but John says the very worst thing I can do\r\nis to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel\r\nbad.\r\n\r\nSo I will let it alone and talk about the house.",

John is kept in town very often by\r\nserious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.\r\n\r\nSo I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the\r\nporch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.\r\n\r\nI’m getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper. Perhaps\r\nbecause of the wallpaper.\r\n\r\nIt dwells in my mind so!\r\n\r\nI lie here on this great immovable bed—it is nailed down, I believe—and",

If that woman\r\ndoes get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!\r\n\r\nBut I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!\r\n\r\nThis bed will not move!\r\n\r\nI tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I\r\nbit off a little piece at one corner—but it hurt my teeth.\r\n\r\nThen I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It\r\nsticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled\r\nheads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with\r\nderision!"

                "was doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught\r\nstealing, and looked quite angry—asked me why I should frighten her so!\r\n\r\nThen she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she\r\nhad found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John’s, and she wished\r\nwe would be more careful!\r\n\r\nDid not that sound innocent? But I know she was studying that pattern,\r\nand I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!\r\n\r\nLife is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have\r\nsomething more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat\r\nbetter, and am more quiet than I was.\r\n\r\nJohn is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other\r\nday, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wallpaper.",
                "And that cultivates deceit, for I don’t tell them I’m awake,—oh, no!\r\n\r\nThe fact is, I am getting a little afraid of John.\r\n\r\nHe seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nIt strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis, that\r\nperhaps it is the paper!\r\n\r\nI have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into\r\nthe room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I’ve caught him\r\nseveral times looking at the paper! And Jennie too. I caught Jennie\r\nwith her hand on it once.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a\r\nvery quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she\r\nwas doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught",
                "derision!\r\n\r\nI am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the\r\nwindow would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nBesides I wouldn’t do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step\r\nlike that is improper and might be misconstrued.\r\n\r\nI don’t like to look out of the windows even—there are so many of those\r\ncreeping women, and they creep so fast.\r\n\r\nI wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as I did?\r\n\r\nBut I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope—you don’t get me\r\nout in the road there!\r\n\r\nI suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes\r\nnight, and that is hard!\r\n\r\nIt is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I\r\nplease!",
                "John knows I don’t sleep very well at night, for all I’m so quiet!\r\n\r\nHe asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very\r\nloving and kind.\r\n\r\nAs if I couldn’t see through him!\r\n\r\nStill, I don’t wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIt only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly\r\naffected by it.\r\n\r\nHurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town\r\nover night, and won’t be out until this evening.\r\n\r\nJennie wanted to sleep with me—the sly thing! but I told her I should\r\nundoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.\r\n\r\nThat was clever, for really I wasn’t alone a bit! As soon as it was\r\nmoonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I\r\ngot up and ran to help her.",
                "so!\r\n\r\nBesides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.\r\n\r\nI don’t feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for\r\nanything, and I’m getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.\r\n\r\nI cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.\r\n\r\nOf course I don’t when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAnd I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by\r\nserious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.\r\n\r\nSo I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the\r\nporch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.\r\n\r\nI’m getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper. Perhaps\r\nbecause of the wallpaper.\r\n\r\nIt dwells in my mind so!\r\n\r\nI lie here on this great immovable bed—it is nailed down, I believe—and",
                "And though I always see her she may be able to creep faster than I can\r\nturn!\r\n\r\nI have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as\r\nfast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.\r\n\r\nIf only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean\r\nto try it, little by little.\r\n\r\nI have found out another funny thing, but I shan’t tell it this time!\r\nIt does not do to trust people too much.\r\n\r\nThere are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John\r\nis beginning to notice. I don’t like the look in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me.\r\nShe had a very good report to give.\r\n\r\nShe said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\r\n\r\nJohn knows I don’t sleep very well at night, for all I’m so quiet!",

I noticed it\r\nthe moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was\r\nnot bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the\r\nwindows are open or not, the smell is here.\r\n\r\nIt creeps all over the house.\r\n\r\nI find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding\r\nin the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.\r\n\r\nIt gets into my hair.\r\n\r\nEven when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise\r\nit—there is that smell!\r\n\r\nSuch a peculiar odor, too!

But I know she was studying that pattern,\r\nand I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!\r\n\r\nLife is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have\r\nsomething more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat\r\nbetter, and am more quiet than I was.\r\n\r\nJohn is so pleased to see me improve!

He stopped short by the door.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” he cried. “For God’s sake, what are you doing!”\r\n\r\nI kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got out at last,” said I, “in spite of you and Jane! And I’ve\r\npulled off most of the paper, so you can’t put me back!”\r\n\r\nNow why should that man have fainted?

I wake up in the night and find it\r\nhanging over me.\r\n\r\nIt used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the\r\nhouse—to reach the smell.\r\n\r\nBut now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like\r\nis the color of the paper! A yellow smell.\r\n\r\nThere is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard. A\r\nstreak that runs round the room. It goes behind every piece of\r\nfurniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even smooch, as if it had\r\nbeen rubbed over and over.",

                "is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nJohn is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.\r\n\r\nI am glad my case is not serious!\r\n\r\nBut these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.\r\n\r\nJohn does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no\r\nreason to suffer, and that satisfies him.\r\n\r\nOf course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my\r\nduty in any way!\r\n\r\nI meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and\r\nhere I am a comparative burden already!\r\n\r\nNobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am\r\nable—to dress and entertain, and order things.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!",
                "He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no\r\nnear room for him if he took another.\r\n\r\nHe is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nI have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all\r\ncare from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.\r\n\r\nHe said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect\r\nrest and all the air I could get. “Your exercise depends on your\r\nstrength, my dear,” said he, “and your food somewhat on your appetite;\r\nbut air you can absorb all the time.” So we took the nursery, at the\r\ntop of the house.\r\n\r\nIt is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look\r\nall ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then",
                "It is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!\r\n\r\nAnd yet I cannot be with him, it makes me so nervous.\r\n\r\nI suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about\r\nthis wallpaper!\r\n\r\nAt first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I\r\nwas letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a\r\nnervous patient than to give way to such fancies.\r\n\r\nHe said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy\r\nbedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head\r\nof the stairs, and so on.\r\n\r\n“You know the place is doing you good,” he said, “and really, dear, I\r\ndon’t care to renovate the house just for a three months’ rental.”\r\n\r\n“Then do let us go downstairs,” I said, “there are such pretty rooms\r\nthere.”",
                "“The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town\r\njust now. Of course if you were in any danger I could and would, but\r\nyou really are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a\r\ndoctor, dear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your\r\nappetite is better. I feel really much easier about you.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t weigh a bit more,” said I, “nor as much; and my appetite may\r\nbe better in the evening, when you are here, but it is worse in the\r\nmorning when you are away.”\r\n\r\n“Bless her little heart!” said he with a big hug; “she shall be as sick\r\nas she pleases! But now let’s improve the shining hours by going to\r\nsleep, and talk about it in the morning!”\r\n\r\n“And you won’t go away?” I asked gloomily.",
                "“Then do let us go downstairs,” I said, “there are such pretty rooms\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nThen he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and\r\nsaid he would go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed into\r\nthe bargain.\r\n\r\nBut he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.\r\n\r\nIt is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish, and, of\r\ncourse, I would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a\r\nwhim.\r\n\r\nI’m really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nOut of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deep-shaded\r\narbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.\r\n\r\nOut of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private",
                "so!\r\n\r\nBesides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.\r\n\r\nI don’t feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for\r\nanything, and I’m getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.\r\n\r\nI cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.\r\n\r\nOf course I don’t when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAnd I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by\r\nserious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.\r\n\r\nSo I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the\r\nporch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.\r\n\r\nI’m getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper. Perhaps\r\nbecause of the wallpaper.\r\n\r\nIt dwells in my mind so!\r\n\r\nI lie here on this great immovable bed—it is nailed down, I believe—and",
                "“And you won’t go away?” I asked gloomily.\r\n\r\n“Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will\r\ntake a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house\r\nready. Really, dear, you are better!”\r\n\r\n“Better in body perhaps”—I began, and stopped short, for he sat up\r\nstraight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I\r\ncould not say another word.\r\n\r\n“My darling,” said he, “I beg of you, for my sake and for our child’s\r\nsake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let\r\nthat idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so\r\nfascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish\r\nfancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?”",
                "That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don’t care—there is\r\nsomething strange about the house—I can feel it.\r\n\r\nI even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt\r\nwas a draught, and shut the window.\r\n\r\nI get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I’m sure I never used to\r\nbe so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.\r\n\r\nBut John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I\r\ntake pains to control myself,—before him, at least,—and that makes me\r\nvery tired.\r\n\r\nI don’t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the\r\npiazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned\r\nchintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.\r\n\r\nHe said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no"
