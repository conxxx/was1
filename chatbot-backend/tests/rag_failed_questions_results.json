What do\r\nyou think of it, Nippers? Would I not be justified in immediately\r\ndismissing Bartleby?”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, that is for you to decide, sir.

You see how gentle _I_ am, sir. Shall I go and\r\nblack his eyes?”\r\n\r\n“You refer to Bartleby, I suppose. No, not to-day, Turkey,” I replied;\r\n“pray, put up your fists.”\r\n\r\nI closed the doors, and again advanced towards Bartleby. I felt\r\nadditional incentives tempting me to my fate. I burned to be rebelled\r\nagainst again. I remembered that Bartleby never left the office.\r\n\r\n“Bartleby,” said I, “Ginger Nut is away; just step round to the Post\r\nOffice, won’t you? (it was but a three minute walk,) and see if there\r\nis any thing for me.”\r\n\r\n“I would prefer not to.”",

Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?”\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nI threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Turkey and\r\nNippers, exclaimed in an excited manner—\r\n\r\n“He says, a second time, he won’t examine his papers. What do you think\r\nof it, Turkey?”\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon, be it remembered. Turkey sat glowing like a brass\r\nboiler, his bald head steaming, his hands reeling among his blotted\r\npapers.",

I pondered a moment in sore perplexity. But\r\nonce more business hurried me. I determined again to postpone the\r\nconsideration of this dilemma to my future leisure. With a little\r\ntrouble we made out to examine the papers without Bartleby, though at\r\nevery page or two, Turkey deferentially dropped his opinion that this\r\nproceeding was quite out of the common; while Nippers, twitching in his\r\nchair with a dyspeptic nervousness, ground out between his set teeth\r\noccasional hissing maledictions against the stubborn oaf behind the",

But no; he insisted upon his afternoon\r\ndevotions. His countenance became intolerably fervid, as he\r\noratorically assured me—gesticulating with a long ruler at the other\r\nend of the room—that if his services in the morning were useful, how\r\nindispensable, then, in the afternoon?\r\n\r\n“With submission, sir,” said Turkey on this occasion, “I consider\r\nmyself your right-hand man.

It became necessary to examine them. It was an important\r\nsuit, and great accuracy was imperative. Having all things arranged I\r\ncalled Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut from the next room, meaning to\r\nplace the four copies in the hands of my four clerks, while I should\r\nread from the original.

I repeated my request in the\r\nclearest tone I could assume. But in quite as clear a one came the\r\nprevious reply, “I would prefer not to.”\r\n\r\n“Prefer not to,” echoed I, rising in high excitement, and crossing the\r\nroom with a stride. “What do you mean? Are you moon-struck? I want you\r\nto help me compare this sheet here—take it,” and I thrust it towards\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I would prefer not to,” said he.\r\n\r\nI looked at him steadfastly.

                "Nevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless\r\ncuriosity, at last I returned to the door. Without hindrance I inserted\r\nmy key, opened it, and entered. Bartleby was not to be seen. I looked\r\nround anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that\r\nhe was gone. Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for\r\nan indefinite period Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my\r\noffice, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed. The cushioned seat\r\nof a rickety old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean,\r\nreclining form. Rolled away under his desk, I found a blanket; under\r\nthe empty grate, a blacking box and brush; on a chair, a tin basin,\r\nwith soap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of",

Immediately then the thought came sweeping across\r\nme, What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed! His\r\npoverty is great; but his solitude, how horrible! Think of it. Of a\r\nSunday, Wall-street is deserted as Petra; and every night of every day\r\nit is an emptiness. This building too, which of week-days hums with\r\nindustry and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all\r\nthrough Sunday is forlorn. And here Bartleby makes his home; sole\r\nspectator of a solitude which he has seen all populous—a sort of",

Within\r\nthree feet of the panes was a wall, and the light came down from far\r\nabove, between two lofty buildings, as from a very small opening in a\r\ndome. Still further to a satisfactory arrangement, I procured a high\r\ngreen folding screen, which might entirely isolate Bartleby from my\r\nsight, though not remove him from my voice. And thus, in a manner,\r\nprivacy and society were conjoined.\r\n\r\nAt first Bartleby did an extraordinary quantity of writing. As if long",

Thereupon, Bartleby would tranquilly decline, and yet\r\nremain idle as before. Then the lawyer would give a great stare, and\r\nturn to me. And what could I say? At last I was made aware that all",

And for his (Nippers’) part, this was the first and the last\r\ntime he would do another man’s business without pay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bartleby sat in his hermitage, oblivious to every thing but\r\nhis own peculiar business there.\r\n\r\nSome days passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy\r\nwork. His late remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly. I\r\nobserved that he never went to dinner; indeed that he never went any\r\nwhere. As yet I had never of my personal knowledge known him to be\r\noutside of my office. He was a perpetual sentry in the corner.

I offered to\r\nassist him in this endeavor, if he himself would but take the first\r\nstep towards a removal. “And when you finally quit me, Bartleby,” added\r\nI, “I shall see that you go not away entirely unprovided.

I tried\r\nto have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell\r\nhim how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and\r\nJulia.\r\n\r\nBut he said I wasn’t able to go, nor able to stand it after I got\r\nthere; and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was\r\ncrying before I had finished.\r\n\r\nIt is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this\r\nnervous weakness, I suppose.\r\n\r\nAnd dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs\r\nand laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHe said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I\r\nmust take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.",

And Jennie too. I caught Jennie\r\nwith her hand on it once.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a\r\nvery quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she\r\nwas doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught",

Really, dear, you are better!”\r\n\r\n“Better in body perhaps”—I began, and stopped short, for he sat up\r\nstraight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I\r\ncould not say another word.\r\n\r\n“My darling,” said he, “I beg of you, for my sake and for our child’s\r\nsake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let\r\nthat idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so\r\nfascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish\r\nfancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?”",

No, I will not, I\r\ncannot do that. Rather would I let him live and die here, and then\r\nmason up his remains in the wall. What then will you do? For all your\r\ncoaxing, he will not budge.

I wake up in the night and find it\r\nhanging over me.\r\n\r\nIt used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the\r\nhouse—to reach the smell.\r\n\r\nBut now I am used to it.
